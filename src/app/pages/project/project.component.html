<p>The client engaged Slalom to redesign, build, test, and deploy new native iOS and Android mobile apps that adhered to the complex and strict accessibility standards. The mobile apps needed to work with OS features including screen readers and switch controls. Additionally, color contrast ratios, click affordances, and font-resizing standards needed to be met. Slalom provided expertise in designing and building the compliant apps as well as recommending other improvements that could be made in the technology and processes.</p>
<p>Slalom deployed the mobile apps to iTunes and the Google Play store and have since been installed on over 3 million devices. Slalom’s team transitioned the code, accessibility framework and lessons learned, and the continuous delivery build pipeline to the client. This enabled the client to rapidly iterate on the mobile apps and push out subsequent enhancements. Slalom’s team took the original 2.5 app store rating up an entire point to a 3.5.</p>
