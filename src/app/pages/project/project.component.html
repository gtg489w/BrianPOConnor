			<div class="overview">
				<p>A large prepaid mobile carrier in Atlanta needed to redesign, build, test, and deploy new native iOS and Android mobile apps requiring complex and strict accessibility compliance. The mobile apps needed to work with native mobile operating system features including screen readers and switch controls. Additionally, color contrast ratios, click affordances, and font-resizing standards needed to be met. My team provided expertise in designing and building the compliant apps as well as recommending other improvements that could be made in the tangential technology and processes.</p>
				<p>We deployed the mobile apps to iTunes and Google Play stores and they have since been installed on millions of devices. We transitioned the code, accessibility framework and lessons learned, and the continuous build/delivery pipeline to the client. This enabled the client to rapidly iterate on the mobile apps and push out subsequent releases.</p>

			<div class="overview">
				<p>True Respite Brewing Company (<a href="https://truerespite.com" target="_blank">https://truerespite.com</a>) is a craft brewery located in Rockville, MD that opened for business in April of 2018. As the IT Lead and a shareholder, I have provided technical leadership and support throughout the entire process from the initial business plan through current operations.</p>

				<h3>Website</h3>
				<p>The TRBC website has undergone several iterations as the business has grown. Initially, a simple splash page with investor information was built to support the founders during their fundraising efforts. As the business continued towards breaking ground, additional features were added including more information about the brewery as well as a blog. The website continues to evolve as customers need/want more information about the business.</p>

				<h3>Menu</h3>
				<p>The taproom does not have any physical menus and relies solely on a completely custom digital menu. The menu displays a list of current beers on tap along with various other bits of information including ABV and style. If the number of brews drops below a threshold, the menu will display a list of upcoming brews. The footer of the menu shows check-in information pulled from Uptappd. The digital menu also has the ability to display the level of beer remaining in the kegs located in the cooler based on weight. All updates happen in near real-time.</p>
				<p>Along with the menu, a tap management application was built that allows managers to keep the menu up-to-date with what brews are available, sold out, and coming soon.</p>

				<h3>Keg Monitoring</h3>
				<p>We want to give customers some insight into how much of each beer style is remaining so they don't miss out on some of the special batches. There are a few options to monitor the remaining beer of a keg. The first is a flow meter that tracks the amount of beer dispensed. Since we're dealing with consumed liquid, the flow meter needs to be food grade and that becomes incredibly pricey especially when there are 16 taps.</p>
				<p>We opted for the alternative solution which is to weigh each keg to get an estimate of the beer remaining. To do this, we leveraged Wii Fit Boards because they're already equipped with a scale, Bluetooth, power supplies, and are encased. This ensured minimal disruption to the current business processes.</p>

			<div class="overview">
				<p>Talentwise was used to manage staffing of Slalom consultants for 6 offices and over 600 consultants. The application was born from the need to move practice leadership from managing ongoing projects' staffing in spreadsheets to a centralized application. Talentwise provided office leadership with a view into practice staffing, utilization, and future availability.</p>
				<p>Talentwise was initially used by the Atlanta Custom Development practice as was built by myself and a colleague. Once we had the initial application productionalized, we were approached by several other practices who also had a need for a centralized staffing management tool. The application was eventually adopted by the entire Atlanta office before spreading to more offices.</p>
				<p>I continued to own the product, push out enhancements, complete redesign, and manage a few other engineers when they had availability to work on the product.</p>
				<p>Talentwise was in use from December of 2013 through 2017.</p>

				<p>SPEDx was the original d/b/a of Avenir Education and our brand.</p>
				<p>I worked closely with our design lead and our chief communications officer to develop and iterate on a visual brand for our public website. The goal was to develop a look that was friendly and approachable but not too childish. We needed to design for trust as parents, teachers, and school districts would need to be comfortable with granting us access to their students' data. The submarine theme was based on a story involving a student in special education who went on to become a captain of a submarine.</p>
				<p>Once we landed on a design, my role was to build out the functioning website. This process was iterative as we wanted to make sure the animations were smooth and worked on devices of all sizes. We also needed the animations and interactions to help reinforce the story and brand we were targeting.</p>
				<p>The result was a responsive website containing a number of subtle animations - the waves moved, the clouds blew in the breeze, the seagulls flapped their wings, and the submarine followed you through the adventure. All of the fish had their own subtle animations as well.</p>

The mobile app would be gamified and allow employees and store locations to compete against each other for top scores taking advantage of company culture that was already very competitive. Various metrics were also tracked and used to compare against stores/employees receiving the traditional method of training at a computer located in the back room.</p>

				<p>The AT&T Developer Summit was an annual conference hosted in Las Vegas, NV. The summit included a 24-hour hackathon between hundreds of teams to develop applications leveraging AT&T APIs. The top three finalists then presented during the keynote.</p>

				<h3>Concept Overview</h3>
				<p>Finding caregivers for your children, pets, and/or house is a tedious and stressful process. Sitter streamlines that process by giving parents/homeowners and caregivers a platform to connect.</p>
				<p>Leveraging bleeding edge technology from Digital Life, the AT&T API team (Payments, WebRTC, M2X), ESRI, just to name a few, we are able to manage the entire care process from end-to-end providing both parents and caregivers with an elegant, delightful, experience.</p>

				<p>Parents are able to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Research and identify local, potential caregivers and feel safe that the caregivers are who they say they are with White Pages identity verification</li>
					<li>Interview caregivers using WebRTC</li>
					<li>Schedule caregivers and give those caregivers temporary access to components of their smart homes</li>
					<li>Allow caregivers automatic access to their house via the Sitter powered caregiver app combined with technology from Digital Life</li>
					<li>Pay for caregiver services using the AT&T Payments API</li>
					<li>Leave reviews of the caregiver</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Caregivers are able to:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Manage personal availability and interview schedules</li>
					<li>Interview with potential parents</li>
					<li>Get detailed maps of the area around the parent's home. This is especially useful for pet sitters to identify safe walking paths</li>
					<li>Lock/unlock doors and enable/disable alarms based on the schedule outlined by the parent</li>
				</ol>

				<p>The Cruise Communication project was a green-field application built in 2014 to provide a seamless mobile experience from shore to ship for customers during their cruise voyage. The platform consisted of customer facing mobile applications, cruise employee mobile applications, a management portal onboard the ship, and a management portal that aggregated all data and provided fleet management. The platform was focused on delivering onboard communication, increasing customer engagement through content and messaging, and serviced as a commerce platform.</p>
				<p>The Cruise Communication platform needed to enable communication onboard a cruise ship with no internet connection. Additionally, integration was built into the Fidelio room management system to enable financial transactions and passenger/manifest synchronization.</p>
